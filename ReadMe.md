# Point of Sale (POS) System

## Overview
This is a simple **Point of Sale (POS) System** written in Java. It allows cashiers to log in, process sales, generate bills, and manage products. The system reads product and cashier data from CSV files and provides an interactive command-line interface for operations.

## Features
- Load product and cashier data from CSV files.
- Register new cashiers and authenticate them.
- Process sales by adding products to a bill.
- Apply random discounts to purchased items.
- Generate a total bill and handle payments.

## Project Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ Main.java           # Entry point of the application
â”œâ”€â”€ Cashers.java        # Handles cashier login and registration
â”œâ”€â”€ Product.java        # Represents products with attributes like name, price, weight, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ billGenarator.java  # Manages bill creation and cost calculations
â”œâ”€â”€ billItems.java      # Represents individual items in a bill
```

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository** (or download the source files).
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd pos-system
   ```

2. **Prepare CSV files** for cashiers and products:
   - `Cashiers.csv` (Format: `name,password`)
   - `Product.csv` (Format: `code,name,quantity,price,weight,unit,company`)

3. **Compile and Run the project:**
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   java Main
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the program and choose an option:
   - Register a new cashier.
   - Log in as a cashier.
   - Exit the system.
2. After logging in, the cashier can:
   - View available products.
